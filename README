SECTION C 
Answer to Array of TravelPass Objects vs. Array of TravelPass Pointers:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Because we run into the slicing problem. When we cast back to a TravelPass
object, we will lose information about the derived objects. We cannot get
that information back afterwards.

Also, using a vector is preferred over using an array.


Any other notes for the marker:
-------------------------------
The input and output methods inside the MyTic class were not implemented
because I did not want too much coupling. I left the input to the UI class.

For Task C, I implemented the input methods in the derived classes, but
left out the error checking. This was just to show that I understood the
concept. Again, I left the error checking of input to the UI class as I
saw this a more suitable fit.
